          <div className='container border border-light  '>
            <p className='mt-3  '>We’re not just another digital agency. We’re a<span className='fw-bold'> mission-driven team </span> of creatives, strategists, developers, and marketers who believe in doing things differently — with <span className='fw-bold'> purpose, honesty, and impact</span>.</p>
            <p><span className='Codyatra'>Codyatra</span> was born with a clear vision:
              To help startups, small businesses, personal brands, and local entrepreneurs<span className='fw-bold'> grow with
                digital clarity</span>, without falling into the trap of fake promises or confusing jargon.</p>
            <p>In a world flooded with copy-paste marketing, bots, and surface-level design — we stand for
              <span className='fw-bold'> depth, personalization, and long-term value</span>.</p>

            <div className="container secondHead lh-1 border ">
              <p>We saw a problem.</p>
              <p>Too many businesses were spending money on digital services without truly understanding
                what they were getting — or worse, getting no results at all.</p>
              <p>Too many agencies were offering overpriced services with cookie-cutter templates,
                automated solutions, and zero involvement.</p>
              <p>So, we decided to create <span className='Codyatra text-decoration-underline'>Something Better , Something Real , Something that actually Cares.</span></p>
              <p>That’s how <span className='Codyatra'>Codyatra  started — a journey (“Yatra”) </span> to bring clarity, creativity, and strategy into the digital lives of modern businesses.</p>
